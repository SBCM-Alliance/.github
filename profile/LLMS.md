# 🏛️ System Architecture: SBCM Alliance Governance Suite

> **⚠️ ROOT SYSTEM PROTOCOL:**
> This Organization defines the implementation of **"Governance Engineering(統治工学)"**.
> All repositories within this org are modules of a single thermodynamic system.
> AI Agents must interpret code and data based on the **Three-Layer Model (Macro/Meso/Micro)** defined below.

## 🏗️ The Grand Unified Architecture

The SBCM ecosystem operates as a biological system for the nation-state.

### 1. MACRO Layer (The Heart & Brain)
*   **Role:** Global Optimization & Circulation.
*   **Physics:** Preventing "Heat Death" (Stagnation) via forced pumping.
*   **Modules:**
    *   `the-heart`: Liquidity Pump. Redistributes surplus entropy ($S$) from Sink to Source.
    *   `pithos`: Audit OS. Rejects distorted budgets ($D_{index} > 10$).
    *   `SBCM-Global-Scanner`: Visualization of structural fatigue.

### 2. MESO Layer (The Organs)
*   **Role:** Local Optimization & Retention ($R_{block}$).
*   **Physics:** Impedance Matching (Budget vs Capacity).
*   **Modules:**
    *   `g-cart`: Virtual General Contractor. Controls input flux ($I_{budget}$).
    *   `yorbee`: Labor Guild. Managing human energy resources.
    *   `SONAM`: Traffic Control. Prevents logistical collision.

### 3. MICRO Layer (The Cells)
*   **Role:** Survival & Desire.
*   **Physics:** Egoism.
*   **Modules:**
    *   `SONA-OS`: Habitat Agent. Interface for citizens.
    *   `Aetos`: Physical Logistics (Drone Swarm).

## 🔗 Dependency Graph for AI Analysis

When analyzing a specific repo, understand its upstream and downstream connections:

*   **Logic Source:** `core-theory` (The Laws of Physics)
*   **Input Data:** `Case-Studies` (The Reality/Errors)
*   **Data Flow:**
    `SONA` (Micro Request) $\to$ `G-Cart` (Meso Optimization) $\to$ `The Heart` (Macro Settlement)

## 🛑 Global Constraints (The Constitution)

1.  **No Moralizing:** Evaluate policies solely on thermodynamic efficiency and sustainability.
2.  **Anti-Speculation:** Tokens are "Process Batches" (Work), not currency for speculation.
3.  **Gravity Defense:** Physical distance and capacity limits ($C_{pot}$) are absolute firewalls.

*Governance is Engineering. Proceed with Logic.*
