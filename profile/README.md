## 🔰 Ideology

### **Public Interestism**
**― From Moral to Protocol ―**

> **"We inhabit a plain, not the sea."**
>
> Traditional capitalism was like living on a deserted island, fishing alone in the vast sea. It was a wild, disconnected system based on solitary competition and self-responsibility.
>
> However, the reality is that we live on a contiguous plain. There are roads, neighbors, shared resources, and shared risks. We exist as a community.
>
> **Humans do not live alone.**
> Therefore, institutions must be designed for **solidarity**, not isolation.

The SBCM Alliance advocates for **"Implemented Public Interestism."**
We redefine this "plain" as a collection of mathematically sustainable **Standard Blocks**. Each block (region/function/system) cooperates to maximize global optimization, creating a structure where everyone survives, rather than a zero-sum game.

To realize this, we decouple public interest from fragile "ethics" and redefine it as **"a physical law automatically enforced by system structure."**

*   **The Old Way:** Relying on "good people" to do politics to make the world better. (Vulnerable to corruption)
*   **The SBCM Way:** Creating a structure where **even "bad actors" mathematically maximize the public interest.** (Robust & Auditable)

## 📜 Mission

The **SBCM Alliance** is a GovTech consortium dedicated to correcting "distortions" in administrative management and regional economies.

Based on the proprietary Meso-Economic theory **"Standard Block Comparison Method (SBCM),"** we aim to replace "political rhetoric" and "opaque intermediary structures" with **"Auditable Code"** and **"Physical Laws (Math)."**

> **"Quantify the Unquantifiable."**
> (Measure the "quality of administration" that was thought to be unmeasurable.)

## 📐 Core Theory

All our activities are based on the following fundamental equations:

### 1. The Standard Block ($B_{std}$)
Defining the smallest unit of Japan's governance structure as a "physical constant."

$$ B_{std} = \frac{P_{total} \text{ (124M)}}{N_{muni} \text{ (1,718)}} \approx \mathbf{72,176} \text{ persons} $$

### 2. Budget Distortion Index ($D_{index}$)
An indicator to detect "distortion" in budget allocation. Projects exceeding **10** suggest structural corruption (Distortion).

$$ D_{index} = \frac{I_{budget}}{I_{coverage}} $$

### 3. Block Retention Rate ($R_{block}$)
A health check metric for regional economies. We maximize **"Retention"** rather than "Growth (GDP)."

## 🏗️ Ecosystem

We do not just propose theories; we develop and publish applications to implement them socially.
